### NOTE

Choose the type of website carefully, as you will be building on it with each assignment that follows.


### Brief
Design a style tile for your client presenting them with the various design elements you intend to use on their website. Your style tile should be easy to comprehend, and the information presented should be relevant to the business of the client and the target audience the client wants to reach through the website.

The style tile should consist of the following design elements:
- A simple logo.
- A colour palette.
- Typography choices.
- Icons and buttons.
- Photos and textures.
- Hyperlinks.
- Brand Adjectives.


### Process
Analyse the challenge and consider the target audience of the web page.

If you are unsure about what a style tile is refer back to Lesson 2.4 'Font Pairings, Usability and the Style Tile'.

Write down and sketch out some ideas.

Do research on different typefaces to find the right mood and combinations. Don’t forget about the target audience.

Create a color palette. Use ContrastChecker to make sure that your colors are WCAG compliant. Elements like text need to have enough contrast with the background color they’re placed on.

Create design elements, such as icons and buttons for navigation, patterns, textures and images. Add a version number to the style tile.

The images used on the Style tile should be resized before importing them to Adobe XD. For this purpose, you can use any raster graphics program, such as Adobe Photoshop.

Open Adobe XD and create a 1920px x 1080px page.

Think of the type of grid structure you want to use.

It’s very important to ensure that all elements are correctly aligned and properly spaced out.

Make sure the overall layout of the Style tile is easy to follow and easy to comprehend.

You can download this Adobe XD template of a style tile to assist you in the process: Style Tile Adobe XD

Generate a link to your style tile by clicking 'Share' on Adobe XD. The link generated is link you should submit on Moodle for assessment


### Submission
A link to your style tile shared submitted on Moodle.

Please include a PDF report on the process you went through to complete this MA and the final product. Your report should include reflection on your submission and must have at least the following main sections: introduction, body, conclusion, and references (if applicable). Your report must be 700-1000 words.



## HTML & CSS Course Assignment

### Goal
To put into practice everything you’ve learned about HTML and CSS over this course.

### Brief
You need to deliver a properly functioning, responsive website for the assignment brief that you chose in Design 1.

The site needs to have every page listed in the site architecture on your chosen brief. Certain functionality that requires JavaScript can be mimicked for now, for example a log in page could link across from the ‘Sign in’ button.

The HTML should be semantic and neat.

The CSS should follow the DRY principle and be easy to read.

The website should be responsive and look good at every screen size with no horizontal scrollbars. Use Flexbox and CSS Grids where appropriate. Please do not use a CSS framework like Bootstrap, we want to see that you can build responsive sites without the help of a framework.

The site should be WCAG compliant and accessibility taken into account.

Each page should have a unique meta description, title, and h1.

You should not use copied code in your submission. All code submitted must be written by you. You may use external sources to show you how to achieve specific effects, and these should be included in your report.


### Submission
You need to submit:

- A link to your GitHub repository. Your last commit must be before your deadline.
- A link to your website live on Netlify.
- A PDF report on the process you went through to complete this CA and the final product. Your report should include reflection on your submission, and must have at least the following main sections: introduction, body, conclusion, and references (if applicable).

Your report must be 600-1000 words.


## Interaction Design Course Assignment

### Brief
In this assignment you will work on your cross-course project to:

Ensure that the website is user-centric.

Ensure that the website is focused on helping users achieve their goals clearly and simply.


### Level 1 Process
Look over the data collected from Hotjar and determine whether there are any aspects of the site that could cause problems for users. Consider conducting further contextual inquiry interviews. These interviews will allow you to see users interacting with the site in-person.

Perform accessibility testing on your website to ensure it’s easy to use for users with accessibility issues.

Decide on which areas of the site to focus and then improve the interactions for users.

Use your skills in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to improve the website.

Once you’ve added your changes, test the site with at least one more user (preferably 3-5). Gain feedback from the user and determine whether the changes you’ve made have improved the issues on the website.

Write a report detailing the research you conducted during this course, and include the changes you made to your website.


### Requirements
Because your sites will all have slightly different designs, the areas that need improvement will be different. But by the end of the course assignment, you should have at least updated the following:
- The purchase/cart functionality
- The contact form with JavaScript validation

### Submission
- Link to the updated website.
- A report covering the research conducted and the updates made to the site.
