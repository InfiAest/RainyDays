## Description
You need to deliver a properly functioning, responsive website for the assignment brief that you chose in Design 1 (Rainy Days).

The website should be responsive and look good at every screen size with no horizontal scrollbars. Use Flexbox and CSS Grids where appropriate. Please do not use a CSS framework like Bootstrap, we want to see that you can build responsive sites without the help of a framework.

### Project requirements
The site needs to have every page listed in the site architecture on your chosen brief(Rainy Days). 
- Home
- List of Jackets
- A jacket specific page showing the jacket
